# Color Generator ðŸŒˆ

> PROD [Live] : https://react-color-generator-v2-prod.netlify.app/

#### Color Generator consists of a straightforward user interface where there is a

- List of **tints** and **shades** of color for a given input along with the page title *Color Generator*.
- The default color in the input is set to **orange** `#f15025` when the page loads.
- User can input the color value either using the **color picker** interface or providing the valid **hex** value.
- If a color is not found for the given input, it shows the toast **Error** message.
- Each single color card has **Background color**, **Weight**, **Hex Value** of the color along with the functionality of copying the Hex value of the color on       click of that specific card showing the toast message *Copied to clipboard*.
- Colors are handled by the `values.js`, toast messages are implemented using `React Toastify` and styles are handled by `index.css`
- To run the project locally, clone the repo, `npm install` to install the dependencies, and `npm run dev` to start up the development server on default port 5173.
